In a faraway war-torn country, the main character lived with
his family in Ravka.
As is the case with such places, food and water was scarce
and medical aid was difficult to get.

One day, a missile detonated near Ravka and the debris fell like a
shower over the town.

Some of the wreckage fell over his little kid and the little child
was injured and needed “Cyanjiv”, an extremely rare medicine
that could cure any type of injury and sickness and only available
to the higher officials known as Glades.

The Glades organised a tournament called “Arena of Death”
with Cyanjiv as the prize.

All the players had to dodge the bullets dropped by
the enemy helicopters and the last man standing would
get Cyanjiv as the prize.

The main character also decided to participate in this tournament
to obtain Cyajiv for his child. But the more he dodged, the more
the levels became difficult and hard to survive.

Luckily, to protest against the oppression of Glades, the vigilantes
of the city hijacked some helicopters and helped the players by
dropping health aids and other beneficial items. Now, it is up
to the player to ensure that the main character is able to win
the game and receive Cyanjiv for his kid.
